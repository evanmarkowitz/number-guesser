## Our Number Guesser
****
The Number Guesser gives two challengers the option to play against each other to guess the random number generated. A previous score pops up on a scoreboard below the submission box after submitting guesses. When one of the players wins, a winning card pops up in the right column. In the mobile and tablet versions, the scorecard is below the scoreboard.
